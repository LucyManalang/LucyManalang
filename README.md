# Hi, I'm Lucy!

→ **Rising Junior at Macalester College**  
→ **Computer Science Major | Studio Arts Minor**  
→ **Researcher, ML/AI Fellow, and HCI Enthusiast**  

I’m passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered software—especially where tech meets design, education, and accessibility. Whether it’s working on extended reality research, mentoring peers as a Head TA, or learning about machine learning and AI through Break Through Tech @ Cornell Tech, I thrive in spaces that blend technical rigor with creative impact.

Currently, I’m exploring how HCI principles can enhance interaction in 2D/3D XR environments and designing systems that support learning and productivity.
